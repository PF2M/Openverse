<p>I'm not finished with this yet, so here are the basic rules:<br>
<b>1.</b> No porn or gore, my hosting provider doesn't like that and a lot of people don't want to see that either.<br>
<b>2.</b> Don't harass people unless it's a joke and it's clearly a joke to all parties involved.<br>
<b>3.</b> No hacking people or the website.<br>
<b>4.</b> Try to stay mostly on-topic within the community you're discussing. This won't be enforced too much unless you're raiding communities or something like that.<br>
<br>
That should be it, really. Ask me if you need any help.</p>
